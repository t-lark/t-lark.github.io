We have so many systems these days, our systems have systems. It doesn’t have to be complex and daunting to get reliable, and up-to-date data. Getting accurate data, while getting it fast, is key to developing data driven strategies. We no longer have to live in the constraints of capacity, limited storage, and limited scalability. With the power and scale of the cloud, you can now simply just ship all of your IT/Ops data to a centralized location and share it among your teams. IT/Ops shops often find some sort of niche tool that was designed for their purpose. These tools are fine, but they are often complex, and require specialized knowledge. Then sometimes you are faced with figuring out what data to ship. For example, some data tools might transform the data during the shipping process. Breaking it out into say a JSON doc, and then creating indices for these files, and tagging them with metadata. This made it even more complex as you would have to design all of these things up front, or suffer the rite of passage of remodeling your data ingest and re-indexing your data when you need to change something. Snowflake has solved these problems in a pretty straight forward way. With Snowflake, you just ship all your data. You can then use post processing to make the data more actionable. Ship all the raw data you can, and then store that raw data in a schema with in the Snowflake platform. No need to spend countless hours of labor on this. You also do not have to worry about indexing, or tagging your data. You can just post process all your raw data with in Snowflake.

Use the data to fix what is wrong Fix things upstream, so next data ingest it will be fixed downstream Establish baselines, sources of truth and context to your data Data with out a source of turth or context is sometimes not as valuable I really cannot stress this enough. I had to admit some methods I had been using for years, which I thought to be pretty solid, were in fact wrong. I also stopped treating MDM data as a single source of truth. When you think about it, this makes actual logical sense. MDM admins often only have the MDM tools to work with though, so they build deep knowledge and skills around these tools. So much, that it gives them Tunnel Vision The big lesson learned here is that the MDM collecting third party agent data is at best a nice to have, but the actual source of truth is cloud data from the agent’s SaaS. That is what matters the most in context. Not if some Launch Daemon is running, or an agent binary can return stdout, or the plethora of other tricks us Mac Admins have come up with over the years to verify if local agents are actually healthy. I found out through collecting data that methods I had been using for years really were not as effective as I thought they were. I discovered I was wrong. To define a healthy agent, that agent has to submit data back to its cloud tenant, and if the agent is not submitting data, then it does not matter what the local state data says. So, now I have set my source of truth to the App stack each agent talks to, and the context of the data is around when was the last time that agent phoned home and submitted data? The rest of the data are just nice to haves, and sometimes that data is not as useful as we thought it was. All I had to do was build my context and request that set of data to the teams that owned that data, and they shared that data to me directly. Now I have the ability to query agent connection statuses from the actual source of truth of the agent, and I am not relying on MDM data to detect these failures for me. All queries and data here are samples from actual data. While they are small sample sets, and things have been changed to share in this blog, the concepts are very real world applicable.

We track what Org assets are assigned to what human in this system. Also, we spent lots of effort cleaning up our sub statuses of assets in Service Now. Things like classifying systems as primary, or as secondary. We have also classified assets that are designated as Zoom Room computers. Leveraging data like this helps a ton on things you haven’t even planned for yet. Anything you add upstream in Service Now, will be ingested downstream into Snowflake later on. So, we use Service Now as our source of truth for asset tracking. One example is that we query to check if primary assets are checking into MDM in the last 30 days. We chose 30 days as the metric for this simply because employees take time off. Plus there are holidays, and many other reasons an employee would not be working. However, it is probably extremely rare for an employee to be out of the office and offline for over 30 days. Example Query: Primary Assets from Intune that have not checked in for over 30 days // get latest compliance log from Intune on Win10 clients over 30 days SELECT SN.SUBSTATUS as type , SN.EMAIL as email , SN.SERIAL_NUMBER sn_serial , IM.JSON_DATA:properties.SerialNumber::varchar im_serial , IM.JSON_DATA:properties.LastContact::varchar as im_last_inv FROM DB.SCHEMA.SERVICENOW_ASSETS as SN JOIN DB.SCHEMA.INTUNE_DEVICECOMPLIANCE_LOGS as IM on SN.SERIAL_NUMBER = IM.JSON_DATA:properties.SerialNumber Where type = 'primary' QUALIFY 1 = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY im_serial ORDER BY im_last_inv DESC) AND TO_TIMESTAMP(IM.JSON_DATA:properties.LastContact) \u003c dateadd(days, -30, current_timestamp()) ; Example Query: Primary Assets from Jamf that have not checked in over 30 days // get lastest inventory webhook from jamf on clients over 30 days SELECT SN.SUBSTATUS as type , SN.EMAIL as email , upper(SN.SERIAL_NUMBER) sn_serial , JI.EVENT:serialNumber::varchar ji_serial , JI.WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::string::TIMESTAMP_LTZ as ji_last_inv FROM DB.SCHEMA.SERVICENOW_ASSETS as SN INNER JOIN DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_INVENTORY as JI on SN.SERIAL_NUMBER = JI.EVENT:serialNumber Where type = 'primary' QUALIFY 1 = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ji_serial ORDER BY ji_last_inv DESC) AND TO_TIMESTAMP(JI.WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003c dateadd(days, -30, current_timestamp()) ; Discoveries from the Data All software agents can break, MDM clients can get into weird states, and even things like an OS update can cause issues. A lot of times you just need to reboot the computer to fix these too. This is just an easy way to report on them and make the data actionable. We are also using Service Now as the source of truth here and not our MDM services. This is really just because MDM solutions aren’t normally true asset management systems. Use the right tool for the right job.

If you are an Org that allows BYOD, you might not have a great way to tell what devices are BYOD. Devices sometimes also may not end up in your asset system for whatever reason. With having multiple data sources in Snowflake you can easily join tables from these sources to craft such data sets. BYOD systems are probably not in your asset tracker as they are not Org owned. A failure also may occur in your process to import assets, or data was entered wrong. This is also pretty easy to solve when you have access to the proper data. Example Query: Devices Checking into MDM but not present in Service Now SELECT JI.WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::varchar::TIMESTAMP_LTZ as last_contact , JI.EVENT:computer:serialNumber::varchar as j_serial from DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_CHECKIN as JI WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(days, -30, current_timestamp()) QUALIFY 1 = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY JI.EVENT:computer:serialNumber::varchar ORDER BY last_contact DESC) and not exists( select upper(SN.SERIAL_NUMBER)::varchar as sn_serial from DB.SCHEMA.SERVICENOW_ASSETS as SN where sn_serial = JI.EVENT:computer:serialNumber::varchar ) ; In the above query we are using each unique device’s last check-in into Jamf from the Webhook Event in the past 30 days, and we only need the event data for this. Then if we cannot join that unique ID (serial number in this case) to the Service Now assets table, then it does not exist in Service Now. You also now have all the serial numbers which you can use to create those asset objects in your asset tracker. Visualization Example: Discoveries from the Data What we discovered is that most of the time when a device does not show up in Service Now, there is likely some sort of data entry issue. Either our automation with our resellers had a glitch, or perhaps a human mistyped a character in for an asset that was manually entered. We also discovered that sometimes if you scan a serial number barcode off of the box the laptop was shipped in, it will append the beginning of the string with a S. On rare occasion we just missed getting it in our asset tracker. My favorite discovery though by far with this data point, was that if a human enters a serial number in Service Now with all lower case characters, it will fail on the table join. The matching is case-sensitive. To fix this, I simply now sanitize my data in post processing by converting all serial numbers to all upper case with the upper() function. This goes to show you how powerful this data platform is. Sure, we could have fixed our data upstream, but will you ever be able to really stop humans from making simple human mistakes? Having this data allowed us to drill down into each edge case and failure point and discover why it was happening. With the best part being is that we have the data to fix it!

I love SaaS Apps, because as an IT/Ops person that means all the management of the App is on the vendor. I can focus on other things, and not have to worry about the app itself, nor the infrastructure required to self host the App. One of the very few downsides of using SaaS is that you often lack access to data. This is especially true when looking at operational data, or access to data that requires direct access to the host. In this case we will be using event based data shipped from Jamf Cloud Webhooks. Example Query: Total Number of Events every hour SELECT ( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_APIOPS where TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(hours, -1, current_timestamp()) ) as APIOPS, ( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_CHECKIN where TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(hours, -1, current_timestamp()) ) as CHECKINS, ( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_INVENTORY where TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(hours, -1, current_timestamp()) ) as INVENTORIES, ( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_POLICIES where TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(hours, -1, current_timestamp()) ) as POLICIES, ( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_CHECKIN where TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(hours, -1, current_timestamp()) AND EVENT:trigger = 'enrollmentComplete' ) as ENROLLMENT ; In the above query I am tracking the total count of each event type by the common events we want to track from our Jamf Cloud instance. The above query also is tracking the number of events per the last hour, and you could adjust this part of the query dateadd(hours, -1, current_timestamp()) to expand the time threshold. Example Query: Total API Operations in last 24 hours select count(*) as total , EVENT:authorizedUsername::varchar as usr , EVENT:operationSuccessful as state from DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_APIOPS where TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(days, -1, current_timestamp()) group by state, usr ; Caveat - Come to find out Jamf does not ship event hooks on failed API operations unfortunately. I have brought this to their attention and asked for this as a feature request. In this case I think tracking failures is more important than the successful operations. Visualization Example: Discoveries from the Data This data is useful to monitor our Jamf Cloud instance. If events start to spike heavily in either an uptrend, or a downtrend pattern, something is probably wrong. I did use this data to detect an impacted workflow from an API bug a year or so back. Basically, an API call from JSS-Importer had failed updating a smart group. The actual failure (after tracking it down) was that the Jamf API had timed out and returned a 502. However, it actually did complete the PUT to the smart group, but failed to update the package payload of a policy. This resulted in a policy to install one version of an app, and a smart group based on a different version of the same app. I only caught this because my fleet was constantly spamming my Jamf Cloud with over 80,000 recon in a 24-hour period.

This is a very big and encompassing subject. One could write entire books on this subject alone. So, for this blog post I am going to focus on disk encryption. Which is a part of the CIS framework, and a very common requirement. Example Query: FV2 Status from Jamf SELECT JI.EMAIL , JI.SERIAL_NUMBER , PART.VALUE:\"filevault2_status\"::VARCHAR AS FV2_STATUS , JI.GENERAL:\"last_contact_time_epoch\"::string::TIMESTAMP_LTZ AS jamf_last_contact FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_INVENTORY JI ,LATERAL FLATTEN(JI.HARDWARE:\"storage\") AS VOL ,LATERAL FLATTEN(VOL.VALUE:\"partitions\") AS PART WHERE PART.VALUE:\"type\"::VARCHAR = 'boot' AND EMAIL != 'exclusion-user@company.com' AND jamf_last_contact \u003e dateadd(day, -30, current_timestamp()) QUALIFY 1 = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY JI.SERIAL_NUMBER ORDER BY jamf_last_contact DESC) ; Example Query: FV2 Overall Score from Jamf WITH X AS ( SELECT JI.EMAIL , JI.SERIAL_NUMBER , PART.VALUE:\"filevault2_status\"::VARCHAR AS FV2_STATUS , JI.GENERAL:\"last_contact_time_epoch\"::string::TIMESTAMP_LTZ AS jamf_last_contact FROM DB.SCHEMA.JAMF_INVENTORY JI ,LATERAL FLATTEN(JI.HARDWARE:\"storage\") AS VOL ,LATERAL FLATTEN(VOL.VALUE:\"partitions\") AS PART WHERE PART.VALUE:\"type\"::VARCHAR = 'boot' AND EMAIL != 'exclusion-user@company.com' AND jamf_last_contact \u003e dateadd(day, -30, current_timestamp()) QUALIFY 1 = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY JI.SERIAL_NUMBER ORDER BY jamf_last_contact DESC) ) SELECT COUNT_IF(FV2_STATUS != 'Not Encrypted') / NULLIFZERO(COUNT(*)) AS PERCENTAGE FROM X ; This will return the current FV2 status for every device record that has checked into Jamf in the last 30 days. Devices that have not submitted inventory or checked into Jamf in greater than 30 days go into a separate violation, and will be remediated in a separate flow. Any device returning Pending, Encrypting, and Encrypted are considered in a desired state, and Not Encrypted will be used to calculate the percentage of devices in an undesired state. NOTE: These queries do include an example of how to exclude say a service account that is used on non-human used devices that may not require full disk encryption for their specific use case. Discoveries from the Data This data was one of the easiest ones to address. Jamf will report 4 different states of disk encryption from a device record. They include: Encrypted, Encrypting, Pending, Not Encrypted, and each of these is very self-explanatory. In this data point Not Encrypted is the violation we are looking for. If devices stay in Pending or in Encrypting for long periods of time, then we consider that a violation. The failure point is almost always FV2 was deployed, but the user never rebooted, or in rare instance the MDM just failed to fully enable it.

We wanted to detect how many vulnerable versions we had and then plan on patching after assessing how many vuln versions we had. A simple spotlight script was deployed, and anything that wasn’t the current version got flagged. Since iTerm2 is just a zipped App bundle, we had no idea where the user installed it. We also do not block users from installing their own software and tools, so there could be multiple versions present. Tools like Jamf Pro will not search for Apps outside of a default path unless you specify so in the inventory collection preferences. A quick Spotlight script made sense and it didn’t require much effort.

To sum up the biggest two reasons I will simply put: Good luck putting that BYOD device on term hold Good luck putting that BYOD device on legal hold That being stated, over a few beers a year or two ago I was chatting with a buddy of mine about this topic. Spotlight tagging came into the conversation and I found myself bored about a week later one evening so decided to just add something like this to a DEP Notify workflow. So, I posted it here on my GitHub That project is not tested (except for like once in a VM), nor maintained and was really just meant as a code example. Use at your own risk, and think about not doing BYOD if you can. The code uses similar tooling as the binaries above, but allows for the flexibility of Python. It also interacts with the macOS APIs, so some extended functionality is there. So, there are many uses for Spotlight one can use in IT/Ops workflows.

Just like everything in tech, there are many ways to accomplish this. I have been using a tool for about over a year now called relocatable python. The reasons I chose to use relocatable python were pretty good ones in my opinion. They are: Easy to use Builds full self contained Python environment Easily able to wrap it up in a standard installer PKG Once you have it in an installer package, you can use whatever tools you want to distribute it. Every management tool and application deployment tool should be able to deploy an installer pkg. quick start guide Download the repo from the link above from the directory you wish to download it to git clone https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python.git Look at the --help argument to see what we can do. Ensure you are in the repo folder. % ./make_relocatable_python_framework.py --help Usage: make_relocatable_python_framework.py [options] Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit --destination=DESTINATION Directory destination for the Python.framework --baseurl=BASEURL Override the base URL used to download the framework. --os-version=OS_VERSION Override the macOS version of the downloaded pkg. Current supported versions are \"10.6\" and \"10.9\". Not all Python version and macOS version combinations are valid. --python-version=PYTHON_VERSION Override the version of the Python framework to be downloaded. See available versions at https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ --pip-requirements=PIP_REQUIREMENTS Path to a pip freeze requirements.txt file that describes extra Python modules to be installed. If not provided, certain useful modules for macOS will be installed. Lets make the folders where we want to create our Python environment % sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/acme/ /usr/local/acme/bin Note: I made two directories there and will explain later why. You can put this anywhere you want. In this example I am using /usr/local but if you want it away from user space you can place it in say something like /opt Now lets build our first Relocatable Python Package sudo ./make_relocatable_python_framework.py --destination=/usr/local/acme --python-version=3.8.5 Note: you will see the tool output a bunch fo stuff in the terminal, let it finish Next we will create our symbolic link to make this easier when we want to call this environment in code # go to the bin folder we created cd /usr/local/acme/bin # create a symbolic link to our new framework sudo ln -s /usr/local/acme/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3 python3 # now test it ./python3 Python 3.8.5 (v3.8.5:580fbb018f, Jul 20 2020, 12:11:27) [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. # exit when you are done \u003e\u003e\u003e exit() Finally, you just need to use your preferred packaging tool to add this folder path, including the symbolic link in an Apple Installer Package.

To keep the quick start guide less esoteric I just used /usr/local as the directory to deploy my Python 3 environment into. In practice, I actually do not do this. I deploy to /opt/myorg instead to my fleet. I have worked with lots of clever developers over the years, and they need to often install tools to do their job. Those tools often go into /usr/local, thus I stay out of that area. I let user’s have that space to themselves. Which Python? I also have Xcode on this Mac, and I also installed the Python3 Xcode tools as well. % which python3 /usr/bin/python3 When you install that, it does put python3 in the standard $PATH and if your code calls that path or if you just type python3 in the shell, without typing the full path, you will get that Python environment. Some planning will be needed as well as some decision-making by the IT Admin/Engineer that wants to deploy their own Python. There is no gold standard answer, so you will need to figure out what is the best answer for your team and Org. Requirements.txt file The author of Relocatable Python did something clever, but some may have missed it. They made an assumption that if you were to build a Python3 environment to deploy to your macOS fleet you might want the objc bridge, and tools like xattr So, those tools are just included in the default argument. You should note this just in case you plan on customizing your Python3 package to add more Python packages to it. You will need to add those back. One can view the documentation on how this works. To see what packages you have you can use pip to do so: % cd /usr/local/acme/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin % ./pip3 list This will output a giant list of packages you have installed. If you want to add more packages you should also include the ones the author of Relocatable Python gave you. When using a requirements.txt file it strictly follows that file. Anything not listed will not get installed. Refer to the --help output we used earlier to add the requirements.txt file sudo ./make_relocatable_python_framework.py --destination=/usr/local/acme --python-version=3.8.5 --pip-requirements=/path/to/requirements.txt Mac Admin Community Python There also those in the Mac Admin community who are already maintaining a public Python3 package which anyone can just go download and/or contribute to. You can find the repo here. This method does make design choices for you. If these design choices are okay with you, then this would be the easiest and fastest way to just ship your own Python3 environment to your fleet. Virtual Environments This is also an option, but it seems most Orgs want to ship their own isolated Ptyhon and if they need to create a venv they can do so from the Python they have shipped. Personally, I hae never used a venv outside of my on personal development. I chose to ship the environments, so I can control it. If you want to control venv to a fleet I think shipping your own is the best to start and then build your venv off of that.

I am not exactly sure why they broke, it could have just been a failed install. So, I started tracking the status and version I was shipping in a simple Jamf EA. Here is a quick example I wrote in the shell: if results=$(/usr/local/acme/bin/python3 -V | awk '{ print $2 }') if\u003e then echo \"\u003cresult\u003e${results}\u003c/result\u003e\" then\u003e else echo \"\u003cresult\u003efalse\u003c/result\u003e\" else\u003e fi \u003cresult\u003e3.8.5\u003c/result\u003e This script will return a false value for any broken Python environment. So, I have an ongoing policy that will reinstall my Python3 environment scoped to this EA with a value of false so this is intentional. I highly recommend you never use blank values in anything you use. Always be explicit with your data, you will never know what a null or blank string value will affect, down or up stream. So, you can track it by the version and create policies to auto remediate any broken Python3 environment you encounter ","date":"2020-09-20","objectID":"/posts/shipping-python/:0:2","tags":["macOS","python","python3"],"title":"Shipping Your Own Python to macOS","uri":"/posts/shipping-python/"},{"categories":["macOS","Apple","python"],"content":"Conclusion and acknowledgements You have many options to choose from.

This allows for a near real time feed of event based data which you can consume and leverage to gain insights about your fleet. Jamf provides some documentation online, found here. Webhooks are generated automatically, and near instantly when an event occurs. In the linked documentation above you will see all the possible webhooks and sample data of what each webhook ships. There are many ways to ship webhooks, and you can choose from many paths to take. You can roll your own webhook receiver, you can ship webhooks directly to cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCP Cloud Storage), use one of many data ingestion tools, and so forth. Right now we are leveraging a tool called Fivetran. Fivetran has built in integration to many SaaS and cloud services. What tools work best for your Organization will be up to your Org to decide. Here is how the data flow looks: First we need to configure Fivetran Snowflake Connector After that create the database in Snowflake, for reference here is the documentation This blog post assumes you have this operating and working, as every Org might have different configurations or requirements in their apps, please refer to the official documentation to ensure this is working. With in Snowflake you can have many warehouses, databases, schemas, and a wide range of RBAC controls in place. So, you may need to adjust some knobs to get this to work. Here is what I have created in my dev account: If you have your database setup now we need to log into Fivetran and create our connector. Find the Webhook Conector with in Fivetran and create a new one. You will want to make sure you already have the database in place and Fivetran has the proper RBAC on that table for data ingestion. Here is an example: There will be a Webhook URL once created which you will need to configure in the Jamf Pro Server. Navigate to Settings \u003e Global Management \u003e Webhooks. Create a new webhook, select the event you want to ship (above example was ComputerCheckin), and make sure you select JSON as the data type. Input the URL you generated in Fivetran and any other options you would like to tweak. You can see that I have my schema set and the table set that matches my dev account in the screenshots. For reference: In Fivetran you can select how often data synchronizes with Snowflake. Since Webhooks are event based data, it is my opinion that the faster you can consume the event, the more valuable that data is. So, I have chosen to ingest every 5 minutes. If you want to pick a different time, you may do so. Your Org may have different needs or requirements, but I do strongly suggest you ingest the webhooks as fast as you can. For example, if you are building data around events, the event based data is more valuable if you can get it in near-realtime. Below are the settings I have configured. So that is it! Just repeat this process for each webhook event you wish to ship to Snowflake. Now you can let the data flow right in, and you are ready to query some of the data and get intelligence off of it. Now for some fun. If you want to find out how many times a specific Policy ID has ran on your fleet with in a specific time frame you can do this quite easily. Since Snowflake is highly scalable and allows one to store massive amounts of data you can keep all your historic data as you see fit. Here is an example query: ALTER SESSION SET TIMEZONE = 'UTC'; select count(*), EVENT:policyId as policy_id , EVENT:computer.jssID as jss_id , EVENT:successful as state from \"JAMF_EVENTSDB\".\"JAMF_EVENTS\".\"POLICIES\" where policy_id = '256' and TO_TIMESTAMP(WEBHOOK:eventTimestamp::INTEGER/1000) \u003e dateadd(days, -1, current_timestamp()) group by state, policy_id, jss_id; NOTE: Jamf Pro Webhooks ship with UTC millisecond epoch time stamps COUNT(*) POLICY_ID JSS_ID STATE 2 256 2240 true In the ab","date":"2020-09-19","objectID":"/posts/shipping-jamf-webhooks/:0:0","tags":["data","webhooks","fivetran","jamf","snowflake"],"title":"Shipping Jamf Webhooks with Fivetran","uri":"/posts/shipping-jamf-webhooks/"},{"categories":["data sharing","snowflake"],"content":"Data Sharing is Data Caring ❤️ I have come to the conclusion that there are essentially two types of people when it comes to data. The people that have data, and the people that wish they had the data. Another thought is that I would rather have the data and not need it versus need the data and not have it. For almost the past two years I have had the privilege to work for a great data platform company. The amount of data we have access to increases our return on what we do in the IT/Ops space exponentially. It also helps drive collaboration between teams, allows for centralized data sharing, and enables everyone to make data driven decisions. In a previous life I did have some opportunity to work with various data tools, and use data to help me accomplish my goals. However, I have never had data like I do now. When I worked in vendor space a lot of my exposure to data tools was around what our customer’s wanted. Many of the customers I engaged with wanted to get all their data from my employer’s product. This typically resulted in large projects, and many labor hours to accomplish. There were also almost always caveats with most of the tools we were using that made us make hard decisions. At one previous job I did have more direct exposure and responsibility around a data tool. It took me four to six weeks to get our test instance setup. I had to configure TLS communication for the elastic cluster. Generate certificates, which was a trial by fire process. Then setup the filebeat \u003e logstash \u003e elastic pipeline. At the Logstash level you had to grok your data and create multiple indices, so you were shaping the data before ingesting it. This had a pretty high learning curve and took a lot of time and effort to just proof of concept. Do not get me wrong here, I do think Elastic is a great tool. When I first showed up at Snowflake, I honestly did not know too much about the product other than the basic PR stuff that I had read online, some blog posts, and some Internet posts on various sites. When I wanted to ship webhooks from our MDM solution, I got access to our Fivetran Instance and with in 30-45 minutes of looking at some documentation and tinkering in my dev environment I had webhooks shipping. I could not believe it took me under a hour to figure this out. I was prepared for it to take weeks from previous experiences. One can also just ship the raw data. No need to grok, no need to transform my data before ingesting it, and I have all of it. Enter Data Sharing ❄️ All of our business units ship their data to our data platform. So, every department has their own database, with their own schemas, and their own tables containing all the data they need access to. Since Snowflake’s data platform allows one to have as many databases, warehouses, tables, views, schemas and so forth as they see fit, it allows for easy data sharing. This means we can all share data to each other, and only the data we want to share. All of the data is on the same platform, so you aren’t spinning up a plethora of servers and then configuring them to access each other. The return you get on saved time and labor is already worth it. In the past, I dealt with gatekeepers of data. I was a data gatekeeper myself. IT and Security typically work with each other at most Organizations. Their goals often align with what the business wants. So, to get data you had to deal with each gatekeeper of each system. IT/Ops and Security typically own several systems if not more on each side. Often you would end up with the data gatekeeper emailing you a spreadsheet of the data you requested. If you were lucky you got API access to consume the data on your own. This is not a good experience, and it was definitely not efficient. With Snowflake, we can freely share data between IT/Ops and Security. When the raw data is updated from ingest, all the data shares among our teams is also updated. There is no more always dealing with a gatekeeper and getting a spreadsheet emailed ","date":"2020-09-19","objectID":"/posts/data-sharing/:0:0","tags":["data sharing","snowflake"],"title":"Data Sharing","uri":"/posts/data-sharing/"}]
