<p>With the climate of tech workers in a weird state post Covid-19 pandemic, and with the rise of the tech <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">influencer</a>
I feel this topic is not only relevant, but also important. There are people who really want to break into a tech career
from their current path, and there are people who want to change careers within tech itself. Whether you are looking
to level up your existing career, make a move into a different section of tech, or just trying to break into the
tech industry any way you can, you have likely heard many other people tell their success stories.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I started working in tech back in 1999. My first tech job was a repair technician at a computer store chain. I did
hardware and software repairs, warranty repairs, OEM systems building, and similar support type work. Over the years
I&rsquo;ve likely had a similar experience to most other workers in tech. I have had bad bosses, and good bosses. I  also
have worked with great people, and not-so-great people as well. I will say that I am lucky in the sense that most folks
I have worked with have generally been great, and the not-so-great experiences were very minimal.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="it-teams-are-also-security-teams">IT Teams are also Security Teams</h1>
<p>If you have worked in some tech related job odds are you have also worked with various security teams throughout your career.
There has definitely been a divide between IT teams and Security teams I have observed in my near 25 years working in tech,
but that doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case. During my career I have definitely observed security &ldquo;punting labor&rdquo; over the fence
to IT teams, and I have seen IT teams dig their feet into the ground when security wants to change things. This is just the
wrong way to collaborate with IT and Security teams all together.</p>]]></description>
