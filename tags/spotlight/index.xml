    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_%28software%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Spotlight</a> is a system wide metadata indexing system that Apple has been
shipping since <code>OS X 10.4 Tiger</code>, and has been improved over the years with each OS. I like using Spotlight for some tasks
and general searching for files in Terminal.app.  I also use it for finding anything on my Mac. Typically, I do not use my mouse
or trackpad to find files or navigate to folders. One just needs to hit <code>cmd + spacebar</code> on their Mac to pull up the Spotlight
search menu and start typing.  If you use a Mac, there is a good chance you also use this regularly like I do.  This isn&rsquo;t
anything groundbreaking or new, but I have enjoyed using Spotlight over the years when it fits as a good tool.</p>]]></description>
