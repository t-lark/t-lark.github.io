<p>Jamf Pro has a builtin feature where you have the ability to ship a webhook event when specific events happen in their
application.  This allows for a near real time feed of event based data which you can consume and leverage to gain insights
about your fleet.  Jamf provides some documentation online, found <a href="https://www.jamf.com/developers/webhooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">here</a>.</p>
<p>Webhooks are generated automatically, and near instantly when an event occurs.  In the linked documentation above you
will see all the possible webhooks and sample data of what each webhook ships.  There are many ways to ship webhooks,
and you can choose from many paths to take.  You can roll your own webhook receiver, you can ship webhooks directly to
cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCP Cloud Storage), use one of many data ingestion tools, and so forth.  Right now we are
leveraging a tool called <a href="https://fivetran.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Fivetran</a>.  Fivetran has built in integration to many SaaS and cloud
services.  What tools work best for your Organization will be up to your Org to decide.</p>]]></description>
