<p>Many of you have probably heard of <a href="https://osquery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">osquery</a>, which is software you can install onto a computer that
allows humans to query the OS to return fast and reliable system data. Osquery is not new, and many Organizations have been
using it in various capacity for years now. Vendors and developers also ship osquery with their products these days as well.
This allows a developer or vendor to collect local data fast and reliably for their software and solutions.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="jnuc-2021-recap">JNUC 2021 Recap</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, this will be a quick recap of my experience from the JNUC 2021 virtual conference, and a companion update to
the talk I gave. First, I need to really thank Jamf for putting on a well produced virtual conference. I will admit that
I was a bit skeptical of things like audio and video quality, participant interaction, and the look and feel of pre-recorded
talks. Everything exceeded my expectations. The audio and video quality were very well done. The recorded sessions
were great to watch, and the attendee interaction was a lot better than I expected. We all hopped into various Slack channels
to interact with each other on subjects or about specific talks that were given. While this does not come close to
seeing everyone in person, it still felt great to see everyone virtually. Some of us even hopped on several web conference calls
to interact with each other, talk shop, have a drink, and just in general have some fun.</p>]]></description>

<p>Welcome to Part III of my mini blog series on being data driven with Snowflake. This post will be solely dedicated to
how an organization can leverage a platform like Snowflake to improve their asset and inventory controls. Both <a href="https://t-lark.github.io/posts/ops-data-snowflake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Part I</a>
and <a href="https://t-lark.github.io/posts/ops-data-snowflake-pt2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Part II</a> can be viewed with those links if you haven&rsquo;t read
them yet. This post will focus on end user devices for the most part and not networking hardware, application catalogs,
servers, and so forth.  The concepts in this post could be applied to those things though.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="working-with-data-in-snowflake">Working with Data in Snowflake</h1>
<p>Welcome to Part II of my miniseries blog around Snowflake with IT &amp; Ops Data. If you have not read <a href="https://t-lark.github.io/posts/ops-data-snowflake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Part I</a>,
you may click that link to read it first. Data has always been very important, and Snowflake just makes using the data a ton
easier than we have ever had before. This post will focus on some basic ways one can work with data with in Snowflake.
For this blog I will be focusing on JSON data stored in Snowflake columns. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">JSON</a> documents are very common all over tech. Especially in things
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">REST APIs</a>, so if you haven&rsquo;t worked with JSON
you will work with JSON data most likely at some point.</p>]]></description>

<p>Technology changes very fast, and it keeps getting bigger and more complex.  We have so many systems these days, our
systems have systems.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to be complex and daunting to get reliable, and up-to-date data. Getting accurate
data, while getting it fast, is key to developing data driven strategies.  We no longer have to live in the constraints of
capacity, limited storage, and limited scalability. With the power and scale of the cloud, you can now simply just ship all of
your IT/Ops data to a centralized location and share it among your teams.</p>]]></description>
