    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="it-teams-are-also-security-teams">IT Teams are also Security Teams</h1>
<p>If you have worked in some tech related job odds are you have also worked with various security teams throughout your career.
There has definitely been a divide between IT teams and Security teams I have observed in my near 25 years working in tech,
but that doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case. During my career I have definitely observed security &ldquo;punting labor&rdquo; over the fence
to IT teams, and I have seen IT teams dig their feet into the ground when security wants to change things. This is just the
wrong way to collaborate with IT and Security teams all together.</p>]]></description>
