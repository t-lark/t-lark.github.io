    <description><![CDATA[Hello Everyone, and it has been a while since my last blog post. I have been busy with work and with some other things outside of work as well. However, we did finally release Munki to our fleet last summer. This was a milestone project for us, and while we aren&rsquo;t the first Org to do this, I wanted to share with the community how and why we did this. Everything I will write here has probably already been done by many other Orgs that currently use Munki, and we aren&rsquo;t really doing much that is radically different.]]></description>
