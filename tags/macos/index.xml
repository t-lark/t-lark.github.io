    <description><![CDATA[Data Modeling osquery Data in Snowflake We have been working on many projects the past few months, and osquery data pipelines with the help of FleetDM has been one of our constant works in progress. Before I dive into the data modeling part, I wanted to share how we scaled this data out. We ended up going forward with FleetDM&rsquo;s SaaS offering over self-hosting the app. However, we are still streaming query results from FleetDM cloud to Snowflake over AWS Kinesis Firehose and we now have data streaming from FleetDM into Snowflake at a very fast rate and high volume.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I recently told my dog, Booms, all about how you can use osquery data in Snowflake. Needless to say, he was quite impressed with all the use cases and in-depth data you can model about your fleet of laptops using osquery data in Snowflake.
Booms came to the office with me, and he even got a bit of company swag! As we spent the day working I told him all about all the work my team was doing with osquery.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Spotlight is a system wide metadata indexing system that Apple has been shipping since OS X 10.4 Tiger, and has been improved over the years with each OS. I like using Spotlight for some tasks and general searching for files in Terminal.app. I also use it for finding anything on my Mac. Typically, I do not use my mouse or trackpad to find files or navigate to folders. One just needs to hit cmd + spacebar on their Mac to pull up the Spotlight search menu and start typing.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[With the announcement at Catalina&rsquo;s release that some third party run times will be removed, and the fact that Python 2 is end of life it is time to ship your own. Just like everything in tech, there are many ways to accomplish this. I have been using a tool for about over a year now called relocatable python.
The reasons I chose to use relocatable python were pretty good ones in my opinion.]]></description>
