<p>A lot of Organizations have adopted things like <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CIS Controls</a> and part of those
controls are around patching and vulnerability management. Depending on what version of the CIS controls you are using, this
could be <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator/?version=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CIS 3</a> or <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CIS 7</a>.
This can already be confusing as the controls are very similar between versions but the have moved places in the CIS
framework. One thing I think most tech and security professionals can agree upon, is that patching often to the latest
operating systems is a great way to avoid your fleet of devices from being exploited. Known vulnerabilities have a shelf life,
and bad actors know that some organizations do not patch, or patch extremely slow. So, they develop attacks against
known published vulnerabilities.</p>]]></description>
