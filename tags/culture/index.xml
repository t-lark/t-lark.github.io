<p>I think the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">data-driven</a> is common, and a lot of people are aware of
the term. It also has a broad area of application across many practices. I feel my Org is already data-driven. We use
data in all our metrics, planning, discussions, collaboration and more. However, today during a cross team meeting I
realized that we are also a data-enabled organization. When the term popped into my head I thought maybe I was on to
something new, or perhaps maybe something a bit esoteric. Turns out, I was wrong, and this term is commonly used in areas already.
A quick Google search will show lots of results for <code>data enabled</code>, and <a href="https://timelyapp.com/blog/from-data-driven-to-data-enabled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">here</a>
is a blog post I found from the first page of results.</p>]]></description>
