<p>Many of you have probably heard of <a href="https://osquery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">osquery</a>, which is software you can install onto a computer that
allows humans to query the OS to return fast and reliable system data. Osquery is not new, and many Organizations have been
using it in various capacity for years now. Vendors and developers also ship osquery with their products these days as well.
This allows a developer or vendor to collect local data fast and reliably for their software and solutions.</p>]]></description>
