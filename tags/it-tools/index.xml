    <description><![CDATA[I recently told my dog, Booms, all about how you can use osquery data in Snowflake. Needless to say, he was quite impressed with all the use cases and in-depth data you can model about your fleet of laptops using osquery data in Snowflake.
Booms came to the office with me, and he even got a bit of company swag! As we spent the day working I told him all about all the work my team was doing with osquery.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hello Everyone, and it has been a while since my last blog post. I have been busy with work and with some other things outside of work as well. However, we did finally release Munki to our fleet last summer. This was a milestone project for us, and while we aren&rsquo;t the first Org to do this, I wanted to share with the community how and why we did this. Everything I will write here has probably already been done by many other Orgs that currently use Munki, and we aren&rsquo;t really doing much that is radically different.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Data-Enabled: Post Nudge Campaign Results A lot of Organizations have adopted things like CIS Controls and part of those controls are around patching and vulnerability management. Depending on what version of the CIS controls you are using, this could be CIS 3 or CIS 7. This can already be confusing as the controls are very similar between versions but the have moved places in the CIS framework. One thing I think most tech and security professionals can agree upon, is that patching often to the latest operating systems is a great way to avoid your fleet of devices from being exploited.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Be Data Driven in IT/Ops with Snowflake Technology changes very fast, and it keeps getting bigger and more complex. We have so many systems these days, our systems have systems. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be complex and daunting to get reliable, and up-to-date data. Getting accurate data, while getting it fast, is key to developing data driven strategies. We no longer have to live in the constraints of capacity, limited storage, and limited scalability.]]></description>
