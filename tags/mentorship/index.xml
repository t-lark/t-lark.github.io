    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="mentoring-a-year-in-review">Mentoring: A Year in Review</h1>
<p>Last week I met our intern in person for the first time. They had started with us during the COVID-19 pandemic,
so everyone was still working from home. I took them out for lunch, gave them some company swag, and said
my goodbyes. Our intern has been with us for an entire year, and they are now leaving to go to college.
My employer partners with a local program that helps under privileged Bay Area high school kids get a
real world job experience. This year my team got an intern, and I was designated as the primary mentor. I have mentored
people before, but never for an entire year so this was a brand-new learning experience for me. It was also the very
first time I did this thing remote, and the first time and hopefully the last time during a pandemic. It was a big
learning experience for me as well.</p>]]></description>
