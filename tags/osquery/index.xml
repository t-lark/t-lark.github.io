<p><a href="https://github.com/munki/munki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Munki</a> is a series of tools and a popular application state management tool many Mac Admins across the globe
use. Some out-of-box features of Munki solve problems many commercial MDMs still cannot solve to this day. It allows
a Mac Admin to write some declarative data and have Munki takes care of the rest for you. We use it to manage
and patch all of our third party apps in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">AutoPKG</a>.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Using Custom MDM Payloads for FleetDM Labels</title>

<p>For a long time now it has been considered a &ldquo;bad practice,&rdquo; to join a macOS computer to any sort of directory service.
Long have past the days of Binding to Active Directory, and the ancient lore of <a href="https://krypted.com/tag/magic-triangle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the golden (or magic) triangle</a>
is nearly lost in time, like tears in the rain. The one thing that we could consider missing from these days was the
ability to locally query user and identity data through native tools like <code>dscl</code> in macOS. I have seen very clever
replacement solutions over the years to get this data down to a macOS end user devices across various enterprises, but
one thing has always bothered me about every method I have seen or sometimes used. The common theme was that they were all not very
security focused solutions. At a previous job, LDAP lookups were just straight up open to anyone on network, like it did
not have any authentication at all. When I was in vendor space I witnessed customers having various <code>curl</code> solutions
to grab that data from some system they could cache locally. Typically, these also were not very secure either.</p>]]></description>

    <title>More Osquery Data Modeling in Snowflake</title>

<p>We have been working on many projects the past few months, and osquery data pipelines with the help of <a href="https://fleetdm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FleetDM</a>
has been one of our constant works in progress. Before I dive into the data modeling part, I wanted to share how we scaled
this data out. We ended up going forward with FleetDM&rsquo;s SaaS offering over self-hosting the app. However, we are still
streaming query results from FleetDM cloud to Snowflake over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">AWS Kinesis Firehose</a> and
we now have data streaming from FleetDM into Snowflake at a very fast rate and high volume. We are typically collecting
data from osquery every hour on most things, and we have a lesser number of queries that run every 12 hours or once a
day.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently told my dog, Booms, all about how you can use osquery data in Snowflake. Needless to say, he was quite impressed
with all the use cases and in-depth data you can model about your fleet of laptops using osquery data in Snowflake.</p>

<p>Booms came to the office with me, and he even got a bit of company swag! As we spent the day working I told him
all about all the work my team was doing with osquery. Anyone can see in this pic of him, he is very impressed
with the speed and scale one can leverage data from osquery in Snowflake</p>]]></description>

<p>Many of you have probably heard of <a href="https://osquery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">osquery</a>, which is software you can install onto a computer that
allows humans to query the OS to return fast and reliable system data. Osquery is not new, and many Organizations have been
using it in various capacity for years now. Vendors and developers also ship osquery with their products these days as well.
This allows a developer or vendor to collect local data fast and reliably for their software and solutions.</p>]]></description>
