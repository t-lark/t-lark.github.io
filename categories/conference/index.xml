    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="jnuc-2021-recap">JNUC 2021 Recap</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, this will be a quick recap of my experience from the JNUC 2021 virtual conference, and a companion update to
the talk I gave. First, I need to really thank Jamf for putting on a well produced virtual conference. I will admit that
I was a bit skeptical of things like audio and video quality, participant interaction, and the look and feel of pre-recorded
talks. Everything exceeded my expectations. The audio and video quality were very well done. The recorded sessions
were great to watch, and the attendee interaction was a lot better than I expected. We all hopped into various Slack channels
to interact with each other on subjects or about specific talks that were given. While this does not come close to
seeing everyone in person, it still felt great to see everyone virtually. Some of us even hopped on several web conference calls
to interact with each other, talk shop, have a drink, and just in general have some fun.</p>]]></description>
