    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="data-sharing-is-data-caring-">Data Sharing is Data Caring ❤️</h1>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that there are essentially two types of people when it comes to data.  The people that
have data, and the people that wish they had the data.  Another thought is that I would rather have the data and not need it
versus need the data and not have it.  For almost the past two years I have had the privilege to work for a great
data platform company.  The amount of data we have access to increases our return on what we do in the IT/Ops space
exponentially.  It also helps drive collaboration between teams, allows for centralized data sharing, and enables everyone
to make data driven decisions.</p>]]></description>
