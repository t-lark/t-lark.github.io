    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="turn-an-it-cost-center-into-an-it-cost-savings-center">Turn an IT Cost Center into an IT Cost Savings Center!</h2>
<p>So many times in my career I have heard IT/Ops teams be referred to as overhead. I have also heard IT being described as
&ldquo;just keeping the lights on,&rdquo; and all the adjacent things one can say similar to this. These type of statements has always
made me want to prove that IT isn&rsquo;t really just those type of things. I have always been trying to implement some sort of
cost savings where we can definitively decide where to cut costs. You never want to cut costs around things that have
a high positive impact. Since in many ways you do get what you pay for at times, and what you pay for may be very worth
it. So, IT is a cost savings center, a service provider, an enabler, an enhancer and much more than some of the
stereotypical things you might hear about how people perceive IT.</p>]]></description>
