    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="turn-an-it-cost-center-into-an-it-cost-savings-center">Turn an IT Cost Center into an IT Cost Savings Center!</h2>
<p>So many times in my career I have heard IT/Ops teams be referred to as overhead. I have also heard IT being described as
&ldquo;just keeping the lights on,&rdquo; and all the adjacent things one can say similar to this. These type of statements has always
made me want to prove that IT isn&rsquo;t really just those type of things. I have always been trying to implement some sort of
cost savings where we can definitively decide where to cut costs. You never want to cut costs around things that have
a high positive impact. Since in many ways you do get what you pay for at times, and what you pay for may be very worth
it. So, IT is a cost savings center, a service provider, an enabler, an enhancer and much more than some of the
stereotypical things you might hear about how people perceive IT.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Many organizations today still struggle with hardware refresh, right sizing hardware specs, and understanding the performance
impact of tools and software across their fleet of end user devices. This has been a problem since the beginning of humans
incorporating technology into their professional lives. In my 25+ year career I don&rsquo;t think I have ever had a job where
these problems were considered solved, and I don&rsquo;t think we ever got close to solving them. A major factor we have all faced
while trying to solve this problem is the lack of data compounded by the problem of being able to use and leverage the data
in a meaningful way.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Using Custom MDM Payloads for FleetDM Labels</title>

<p>For a long time now it has been considered a &ldquo;bad practice,&rdquo; to join a macOS computer to any sort of directory service.
Long have past the days of Binding to Active Directory, and the ancient lore of <a href="https://krypted.com/tag/magic-triangle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the golden (or magic) triangle</a>
is nearly lost in time, like tears in the rain. The one thing that we could consider missing from these days was the
ability to locally query user and identity data through native tools like <code>dscl</code> in macOS. I have seen very clever
replacement solutions over the years to get this data down to a macOS end user devices across various enterprises, but
one thing has always bothered me about every method I have seen or sometimes used. The common theme was that they were all not very
security focused solutions. At a previous job, LDAP lookups were just straight up open to anyone on network, like it did
not have any authentication at all. When I was in vendor space I witnessed customers having various <code>curl</code> solutions
to grab that data from some system they could cache locally. Typically, these also were not very secure either.</p>]]></description>

    <title>More Osquery Data Modeling in Snowflake</title>

<p>We have been working on many projects the past few months, and osquery data pipelines with the help of <a href="https://fleetdm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FleetDM</a>
has been one of our constant works in progress. Before I dive into the data modeling part, I wanted to share how we scaled
this data out. We ended up going forward with FleetDM&rsquo;s SaaS offering over self-hosting the app. However, we are still
streaming query results from FleetDM cloud to Snowflake over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">AWS Kinesis Firehose</a> and
we now have data streaming from FleetDM into Snowflake at a very fast rate and high volume. We are typically collecting
data from osquery every hour on most things, and we have a lesser number of queries that run every 12 hours or once a
day.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently told my dog, Booms, all about how you can use osquery data in Snowflake. Needless to say, he was quite impressed
with all the use cases and in-depth data you can model about your fleet of laptops using osquery data in Snowflake.</p>

<p>Booms came to the office with me, and he even got a bit of company swag! As we spent the day working I told him
all about all the work my team was doing with osquery. Anyone can see in this pic of him, he is very impressed
with the speed and scale one can leverage data from osquery in Snowflake</p>]]></description>

<p>Many of you have probably heard of <a href="https://osquery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">osquery</a>, which is software you can install onto a computer that
allows humans to query the OS to return fast and reliable system data. Osquery is not new, and many Organizations have been
using it in various capacity for years now. Vendors and developers also ship osquery with their products these days as well.
This allows a developer or vendor to collect local data fast and reliably for their software and solutions.</p>]]></description>
