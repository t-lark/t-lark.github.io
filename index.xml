    <description><![CDATA[Be Data Driven in IT/Ops with Snowflake Technology changes very fast, and it keeps getting bigger and more complex.

Getting accurate data, while getting it fast, is key to developing data driven strategies. We no longer have to live in the constraints of capacity, limited storage, and limited scalability.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Spotlight is a system wide metadata indexing system that Apple has been shipping since OS X 10.4 Tiger, and has been improved over the years with each OS. I like using Spotlight for some tasks and general searching for files in Terminal.app. I also use it for finding anything on my Mac. Typically, I do not use my mouse or trackpad to find files or navigate to folders. One just needs to hit cmd + spacebar on their Mac to pull up the Spotlight search menu and start typing.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[With the announcement at Catalina&rsquo;s release that some third party run times will be removed, and the fact that Python 2 is end of life it is time to ship your own. Just like everything in tech, there are many ways to accomplish this. I have been using a tool for about over a year now called relocatable python.

    <description><![CDATA[Data Sharing is Data Caring ❤️ I have come to the conclusion that there are essentially two types of people when it comes to data. The people that have data, and the people that wish they had the data. Another thought is that I would rather have the data and not need it versus need the data and not have it.
