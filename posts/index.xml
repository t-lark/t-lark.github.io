    <description><![CDATA[Gain All the Insights You Never Had Asset and Inventory controls are difficult, and many Orgs spend tons of time and effort to try to solve problems around this very subject. In fact, they will hire humans, and spend lots of time and money to also get a hold of their inventory of assets. This problem is still very much difficult to solve, but the Data Cloud makes this problem at least solvable.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Data-Enabled: Post Nudge Campaign Results A lot of Organizations have adopted things like CIS Controls and part of those controls are around patching and vulnerability management. Depending on what version of the CIS controls you are using, this could be CIS 3 or CIS 7. This can already be confusing as the controls are very similar between versions but the have moved places in the CIS framework. One thing I think most tech and security professionals can agree upon, is that patching often to the latest operating systems is a great way to avoid your fleet of devices from being exploited.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Creating a Data-enabled Culture I think the term data-driven is common, and a lot of people are aware of the term. It also has a broad area of application across many practices. I feel my Org is already data-driven. We use data in all our metrics, planning, discussions, collaboration and more. However, today during a cross team meeting I realized that we are also a data-enabled organization. When the term popped into my head I thought maybe I was on to something new, or perhaps maybe something a bit esoteric.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Snowflake, osquery and Fleet is Pure Magic! Many of you have probably heard of osquery, which is software you can install onto a computer that allows humans to query the OS to return fast and reliable system data. Osquery is not new, and many Organizations have been using it in various capacity for years now. Vendors and developers also ship osquery with their products these days as well. This allows a developer or vendor to collect local data fast and reliably for their software and solutions.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[JNUC 2021 Recap Hello everyone, this will be a quick recap of my experience from the JNUC 2021 virtual conference, and a companion update to the talk I gave. First, I need to really thank Jamf for putting on a well produced virtual conference. I will admit that I was a bit skeptical of things like audio and video quality, participant interaction, and the look and feel of pre-recorded talks. Everything exceeded my expectations.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Be Data Driven in IT/Ops with Snowflake Technology changes very fast, and it keeps getting bigger and more complex. We have so many systems these days, our systems have systems. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be complex and daunting to get reliable, and up-to-date data. Getting accurate data, while getting it fast, is key to developing data driven strategies. We no longer have to live in the constraints of capacity, limited storage, and limited scalability.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Spotlight is a system wide metadata indexing system that Apple has been shipping since OS X 10.4 Tiger, and has been improved over the years with each OS. I like using Spotlight for some tasks and general searching for files in Terminal.app. I also use it for finding anything on my Mac. Typically, I do not use my mouse or trackpad to find files or navigate to folders. One just needs to hit cmd + spacebar on their Mac to pull up the Spotlight search menu and start typing.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[With the announcement at Catalina&rsquo;s release that some third party run times will be removed, and the fact that Python 2 is end of life it is time to ship your own. Just like everything in tech, there are many ways to accomplish this. I have been using a tool for about over a year now called relocatable python.
The reasons I chose to use relocatable python were pretty good ones in my opinion.]]></description>
