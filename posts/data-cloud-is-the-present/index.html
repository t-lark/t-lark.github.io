<p>I have been thinking about this blog post a lot before I wrote it. I pined over how to communicate how data cloud
platforms are the future, but ultimately I have decided to scrap that idea. They are not the future, because they are
actually the present. Having a powerful data platform in the cloud you can pipeline all your Org&rsquo;s data to is not a brand-new
thing. It already exists, many Orgs are already doing it, and if you are reading this you should consider leveraging
them too.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of IT specific data tools out there. A lot of them are some form of evolved log shipping tools
that aggregate data to a centralized Sys Log Server, or something similar. These tools are fine, and they are better than
not having any data pipelines or data tools, but IT and Operations shops don&rsquo;t have to settle for IT specific data tools.
IT and Operations teams can leverage all the same data cloud platforms that other teams use. Having all your data in a single
platform is beyond powerful for IT. You will gain insights to your technology stacks, assets, users, software, and so much
more by simply being able to join multiple sources of truth. You will have better data and leverage over your data than
any single software tool can promise you.</p>
<p>So, the Data Cloud is not the future as it is currently the present. Other systems are now considered legacy as they
cannot scale or offer some modern features the cloud can.</p>
<h3 id="being-data-driven-and-data-enabled">Being Data Driven and Data Enabled</h3>
<p>Many organizations strive to be data-driven, and many humans have written books, done keynote presentations, built
frameworks, and more around being data driven. Ultimately you can reduce it to the ability to make decisions based off
of data you have collected, and then leveraged to ensure you are developing a solution or reach an end goal that meets
a specific result. Data is consumed, analyzed, ran through a process, and that process ultimately leads some sort of
desired end result. Many people and organizations are wanting to accomplish this, and many do.</p>
<p>However, being data driven is only part of the equation. You need to ensure your data is good. You need to have domain experts
explain data, apply context to the data, and work with the data. This is where IT can be a huge help to an organization.
IT is oftentimes the stewards of systems, and the custodians of technology stacks that organizations use. Enabling IT
to leverage all and organization&rsquo;s data, share data freely among teams, and training them on how to use these data tools
will have exponential returns. This is what being data enabled means. Enable your IT teams to access data, train them
to use the data tools, allow them to be subject-matter experts in their domain, and share data to them, they can leverage.</p>
<p>These are things I use in my every-day-work life now. My manager has a question for me, I write a query and ask the data. My team
wants greater insights into a process, system or something else, we write a query and ask the data a question. Other teams
want to know about IT systems, we enable them by sharing the data to them. When a security compliance adn governance engineer
wants to build dashboards out of your IT Operations data to show how compliant your end user computing device fleet is, it
is so much better of an experience if IT and Operations teams can just hand the compliance engineer a query. A compliance
engineer is not a subject-matter expert in end user computers, IT is though. This way the data is more accurate and it
drives in cross-team collaboration. This is what being data enabled means to me.</p>
<p>At a process level everyone in your Organization should strive to be data driven, and at an operational level everyone should
strive to be data enabled.</p>
<h3 id="real-world-example---device-compliance">Real World Example - Device Compliance</h3>
<p>We have fine-tuned our data and queries to reflect the most real world data we can. Filtering out things that do not reflect
a specific context, taking additional things into consideration, and using all the data we have to get the absolute most
accurate results we can.</p>
<p>In the beginning things will look horrible, and this is normal. You never had all this data before, how could you have known
every single edge case? How could you have anticipated everything? As Douglas Adams wrote, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic!&rdquo; All this means is
that you have an opportunity to vastly improve things adn the data is showing you all your gaps. This is also where IT can
shine and bring real value to the organization and the data everyone leverages. It also gets better over time, like most
things in life. In the beginning of most journeys it is the absolute most difficult and over time you gain experience and
skills to mitigate that difficulty.</p>
<p>You will deal with number chasers, number chasers want good numbers when it comes to compliance. They oftentimes even ask
for 100% compliance results, which is not easy at all. This is where context matters, and it can matter a lot. One of the
filters I put into place was exited employees. Most orgs have some sort of off boarding process, and that typically also
involves putting their computer into some sort of hold state. This means their Org provided laptop could be locked up in
storage somewhere for some amount of time. This also means it is not online and receiving patches or updates. So, we decided
to filter these systems out of our main data sets of production laptops. We never get rid of data either, we filter them into
buckets with applied context. We still care about the device, but now it is going into another bucket of data with a different
context applied to it. We also filtered out any non-in-use system. So, systems that are out for repairs, or in stock and ready
to be deployed, designated demo systems, digital signage, conference room computers, so on and so forth also get their own context.</p>
<p>Now our numbers looked a lot better to those number chaser folks, and they were actually more accurate under the context of
production employee systems. By design a computer powering the audio/video systems in a conference room doesn&rsquo;t have any
access to any crown jewels data, nor assumes any roles within privileged systems, and really is just sort of a dummy
appliance computer that helps a larger conference room run the hardware with in it. Again, we still care about these systems,
we still report on them, but they just go to different dashboards with different applied context to them.</p>
